I started learning Scala for more than 6 months now and I can clearly relate to the pain points of a beginner. I intend to provide my audience the ease of using Scala language and how it programming even more easier. I would like to live code and help the audience learn with me. Basic and generic scala concepts and day to day codes to make the audience comfortable in the language is my main goal while delivering this talk.
