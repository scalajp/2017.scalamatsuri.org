Spark has become the go-to Machine Leaning platform for the JVM community. It comes with a ML library, which makes things even easier. On the downside it provides you only building blocks, which need to be put together to perform even simple analysis which can be time consuming.

This talk will introduce Sparkling Water, an OS project integrating Spark and H2O, an ML platform which makes your life easier. It provides such features as a web UI with graphs and statistics, automatic cross-validation, parameter search and export of your models as POJO and many more.
